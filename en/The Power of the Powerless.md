Sincerely suggest you to read the essay if you haven't already.

Having read one-fifth of [The power of the Powerless](https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/wp-content/uploads/1979/01/the-power-of-the-powerless.pdf), I can't see much of a difference between the world today and the one VÃ¡clav Havel described. We don't put slogans on grocery windows anymore? Thank god.

I am not really in a good position to suggest anyone to do their part as I am rendered useless by authoritarians. Decided to make a post nonetheless after reading a imgur post.

Had hard time deciding what to quote. Almost every part worths thinking about as they are still very much relevant. So what did they fought for? What progress did we make?

>Let us now imagine that one day something in our greengrocer snaps and he stops putting up the slogans merely to ingratiate himself. He stops voting in elections he knows are a farce. He begins to say what he really thinks at political meetings. And he even finds the strength in himself to express solidarity with those whom his conscience commands him to support.
