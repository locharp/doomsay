I read an article and some related reports and clarifications which was about something Binance did some time ago. From those content I saw something else, it seems that the idea of decentralization is pretty much lost for crypto currencies, with Binance being the biggest centre.
I am not really involved in cryptocurrencies, thus these are just some feelings of a layman. There are some similarities I see from these two matters:
1. Originally it was an idea of letting us take back the control of our finance and our say.
2. We hand over our assets and personal information to central management for efficiency, convenience, applicability and benefits.
3. Before we realize, we no longer "have" what were supposed to be ours. Say, if there is an argument, will you find that you are the one holding it? Or will you have to beg to get it back?
We can also see that people are pretty much the same regardless of origin. Do not presume there will always be a more advanced people who will save the day. People do not want the hassles, just like you and I do not want them. And when none of us wants to deal with them, things are lost before we realize.
