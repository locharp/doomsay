加密貨幣人會是民主的快轉嗎？
前陣子看了一篇文章和相關的報道及澄清，原本的重點是在說Binance的營運手法，但其中看到似乎加密貨幣的去中心化理念經已七零八落，而Binance正是其中最大的一個中心。
我沒有真正參與加密貨幣的行列，所因此說的只是門外漢的感覺，在我來看兩者相似的是：
1. 原來的理念是希望大家能夠掌握自己應有的東西，經濟、話語權
2. 大家為了效率、便利、應用範圍、利益而主動交出資產、個人資料去接受集中管理
3. 不知不覺間理論上屬於大家的東西實際上在誰的手中呢？有爭議時實際決定權又在誰手裏？是在我們手中？還是要哀求別人還給我們？
在這件事上亦多少可以看到，其實世界各地的人也是差不多。不要期望總是會有哪個比較進步的地方支撐大局。你不想煩惱，我不想煩惱，別人也一樣不想煩惱。大家都不想煩惱下，有些東西不知不覺就沒有了。

碼幣會唔會係民主嘅快鏡？
早排睇咗篇文連帶一啲報道同澄清，本身重點係講緊Binance嘅營運手法之類，但裏面睇到似乎crypto(currency)嘅decentralize理念已經得返個講字，而Binance正正係其中最大嘅一個中心。
我就冇玩crypto嘅，所以講嘅只係行外人嘅感覺。望落去令我覺得兩樣嘢似嘅係：
1. 本身理念上希望大家可以掌握返自己應有嘅嘢，錢、話事權
2. 大家為咗效率、方便、應用範圍、利益而主動畀自己嘅資產、個人資料人哋集中管理
3. 唔覺唔覺其實而家理論上屬於大家嘅嘢實際上喺邊個手中？有爭拗時實際上決定權喺邊個手上？係我哋手上？定係要求人哋畀返我哋？
呢件事上亦多少可以睇到，其實世界各地嘅人都係差唔多。唔好期望總係會有邊度比較進步嘅地方支撐大局。你同我唔想煩時，人哋都一樣唔想煩。大家都唔想煩時，有啲嘢不知不覺就冇咗。

Is cryptocurrency a fast-forward version of democracy?
I read an article and some related reports and clarifications which was about something Binance did some time ago. From those content I saw something else, it seems that the idea of decentralization is pretty much lost for crypto currencies, with Binance being the biggest centre.
I am not really involved in cryptocurrencies, thus these are just some feelings of a layman. There are some similarities I see from these two matters:
1. Originally it was an idea of letting us take back the control of our finance and our say.
2. We hand over our assets and personal information to central management for efficiency, convenience, applicability and benefits.
3. Before we realize, we no longer "have" what were supposed to be ours. Say, if there is an argument, will you find that you are the one holding it? Or will you have to beg to get it back?
We can also see that people are pretty much the same regardless of origin. Do not presume there will always be a more advanced people who will save the day. People do not want the hassles, just like you and I do not want them. And when none of us wants to deal with them, things are lost before we realize.
